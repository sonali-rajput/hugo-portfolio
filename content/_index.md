# Hi, I'm Sonali Rajput ðŸ‘‹

**DevOps Engineer & Cloud Computing Student**

</div> -->

Hey, 

I'm a bit of a strange loop myself, a product of physics, chemistry, and math, who found a calling in Computer Science and now orchestrates the digital cosmos. My journey started with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering , and now I'm pursuing an MSc in Cloud Computing with a placement year. 

I live at the intersection of infrastructure and innovation, where I've spent my time building resilient CI/CD pipelines and taming the complexities of AWS and GCP. But my curiosity doesn't stop there. I love exploring the frontiers of technology, especially playing with new tech, AI, and large language models. 

In fact, I've already built a multi-LLM network operations center that reduces manual alert processing from hours to mere seconds. I'm a DevOps maestro who's also an AI tinkerer, always eager to explore what's next and build thoughtforms where code meets canvas.

I like to tweet: @heyiamsra
