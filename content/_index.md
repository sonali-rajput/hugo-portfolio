# Hi, I'm Sonali Rajput 👋

**DevOps Engineer & Cloud Computing Student**

</div> -->

I'm a software engineer passionate about crafting scalable, cloud-native systems. My favorite work lies at the intersection of robust backend development and end-to-end DevOps automation, creating platforms that are not just functional but are meticulously engineered for high performance and reliability.

Currently, I'm a Software Developer Backend at Trovr, where I focus on engineering resilient Go (Golang) microservices using SOLID/DDD principles. In this hybrid role, I also led the build-out of our complete DevOps infrastructure from the ground up. This involved designing automated CI/CD pipelines and deploying containerized services to a scalable GCP and Kubernetes environment, all while embedding security best practices from a DevSecOps perspective.

In the past, I've had the opportunity to apply my DevOps expertise across a variety of settings—from an enterprise software company focused on data management for social enterprises to an IIT-incubated startup developing automation systems for complex organizations. Additionally, I've engineered personal projects like an automated network incident response system, which uses multiple LLMs and vector-based correlation for intelligent root cause analysis.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading about technology, practicing yoga, playing video games, or spending time with my family and friends.
