# Hi, I'm Sonali Rajput ðŸ‘‹

hi,

i am a strange loop dreaming in tensors. i chase the symmetries of nature with physics-informed nets, trace quantum whispers in Hilbertâ€™s shadow, sketch thoughtforms where code meets canvas, and wonder if art, too, is just the universe becoming self-aware.

i studied physics, math, computer science, and often, philosophy in college. i've researched phase qubits for my senior (theoretical) research, and wanna research the intersection of NLP, physics, and the self, to unravel questions like what is intelligence, in an attempt to make LLMs funny.

i am currently living on my friend's farm, studying data-driven science/engineering on my own, building physics-informed NNs and SOTA LLMs from scratch.

i like to tweet: @eigenron
