# DevOps Automation Suite

**Project Status:** Ongoing  
**Technologies:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Tekton Pipelines, Terraform, Ansible, AWS, GCP

## Overview

A comprehensive collection of automation tools and scripts developed during internships at Sarva Suvidhaen and Makerble, focusing on streamlining DevOps processes and infrastructure management.

## Key Achievements

### Container Automation
- **40% Reduction** in manual deployment tasks through Docker containerization
- Automated container builds and deployments across multiple environments
- Standardized application packaging and distribution

### Infrastructure Optimization
- **20% Cost Reduction** in cloud infrastructure through resource rightsizing
- Implemented scheduled scaling based on usage patterns
- Automated resource provisioning and deprovisioning

### CI/CD Pipeline Development
- Built comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Tekton Pipelines
- Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes
- Improved release consistency and reliability

### Monitoring Integration
- Integrated monitoring solutions including Datadog, Grafana, and New Relic
- Implemented automated alerting and incident response
- Enhanced system observability and performance tracking

## Technical Components
