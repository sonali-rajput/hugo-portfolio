# Cococloud: AI-Powered AWS Cloud Management Agent

**Project Date:** March 2025  
**Technologies:** Python, AWS, Ollama, MCP, LiteLLM, Qwen

## Overview

An intelligent cloud management agent that enables natural language interaction with AWS services, making cloud operations more accessible and efficient.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Interface
Built AI agent using MCP server and smolagents for intuitive cloud management through conversational commands.

### Local AI Processing
Integrated Qwen models through LiteLLM and Ollama for scalable local inference without dependency on external AI services.

### Cost Optimization
Developed AWS cost estimation tools using real-time pricing APIs to help users make informed decisions about resource provisioning.

### Modular Architecture
Created reusable cloud resource management modules that can be extended and customized for different use cases.

### Multi-Service Support
Comprehensive AWS service integration including EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, VPC, IAM, and more.

## Technical Highlights

- **AI Integration:** Context-aware conversation handling for complex cloud operations
- **Security:** Built secure credential management system with role-based access control
- **Extensibility:** Designed plugin architecture for extending functionality
- **Performance:** Achieved 60% faster cloud resource provisioning through automation
